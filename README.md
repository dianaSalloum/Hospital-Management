# Hospital Management System 🏥

This is my first Java project created during my first year at university.  
The goal of this project is to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as:

- Classes and Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Encapsulation  

## 📌 Notes
- This is a console-based project.  
- No database or advanced features are used (since the focus is on learning OOP).  

## 🎯 Future Improvements
In the future, I would like to add:
- Database support  
- Exception handling  
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
